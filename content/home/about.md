# Biography

I am a researcher and PhD candidate at the Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy of the University of Antwerp, specialising in analysis of minimum income protection, chiefly using the European microsimulation model EUROMOD. Other research interests and activities include housing policy, poverty and inequality, political economy and its influence on social policy, and universal basic income.
